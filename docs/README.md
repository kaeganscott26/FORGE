# FORGE Documentation

These documents describe current `2.5.0-beta` source behavior unless explicitly marked as historical. Source under `apps/`, `packages/`, `scripts/`, and `.github/workflows/` remains authoritative when documentation and implementation disagree.

## Start here

- [Project README](../README.md) — product overview, installation, development, and documentation map.
- [User Manual](../UserManual.md) — daily desktop use and troubleshooting.
- [User Configuration](../UserConfig.md) — providers, credentials, semantic context, runtimes, and update channels.
- [Project Status](PROJECT_STATUS.md) — current implementation, published-release boundary, and known limitations.
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — ownership, data flow, packages, and runtime boundaries.

## Runtime and capabilities

- [Agent Tools](AGENT_TOOLS.md) — provider-neutral ToolRouter flow and execution records.
- [Tool Security](TOOL_SECURITY.md) — controls that remain after retirement of the approval subsystem.
- [Tooling Guide](TOOLING_GUIDE.md) — user-facing capability inventory.
- [Persistent Tasks](PERSISTENT_TASKS.md) and [Task Recovery](TASK_RECOVERY.md) — durable execution and reconciliation.
- [Semantic Context](SEMANTIC_CONTEXT.md) — optional embedding discovery and authority ordering.
- [Hermes Runtime](HERMES_RUNTIME.md) — implemented detection/fallback and required bridge contract.
- [Integrated Terminal](TERMINAL.md) — user PTY and agent-process separation.
- [FORGE Live](Architecture/FORGE_LIVE.md) — loopback static preview.

## Historical material

Dated audits, implementation logs, superseded planning/review documents, security prompts, and old release verification records are retained in [`archive/`](archive/README.md). They preserve evidence and chronology but do not describe current runtime behavior.
