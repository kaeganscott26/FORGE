# FORGE 2.4 source line

## Current `main` after `v2.4.0-beta`

Current `main` remains versioned `2.4.0-beta` but is ahead of the published tag. It includes:

- workspace-open response recovery: if the open operation succeeds but Electron drops or nulls the response payload, the renderer reloads canonical `workspace.info` instead of storing a null workspace;
- malformed workspace-database recovery from a verified backup while preserving the corrupt original;
- bounded semantic context that keeps explicit tool results, current source, Git, and task/runtime evidence authoritative;
- shared runtime and packaging parity across Linux, macOS, and Windows, including embedded commit metadata, manifests, native architecture checks, and installed-runtime verification;
- branch/runtime audit and documentation consolidation.

These post-tag changes are not in the existing public `v2.4.0-beta` assets. Do not replace those assets or move the published tag. Publish them only under a new semantic version and annotated tag.

## Published `v2.4.0-beta`

The published release added the native semantic-context foundation and coordinated cross-platform packaging:

- optional OpenAI-compatible embeddings, disabled on fresh installs;
- lazy semantic routing with bounded results, deduplication, source freshness checks, Float32 storage, and batched persistence;
- provider-neutral FORGE Intelligence and Native FORGE execution using the shared ToolRouter;
- Hermes CLI/endpoint discovery, skill metadata discovery, and safe Native FORGE fallback;
- Linux AppImage/DEB, universal macOS DMG/ZIP, Windows NSIS, updater metadata, SHA-256 sums, and build manifests.

## Execution model

The current runtime does not contain the retired FORGE approval queue, approval grants, session permissions, or approval IPC. Valid calls to registered and available tools execute through the shared router. Schema validation, root confinement, OS permissions, timeouts, cancellation, rollback/atomic-write protections, redaction, bounded results, network controls, loop-progress protection, and execution-state audit records remain enforced.
